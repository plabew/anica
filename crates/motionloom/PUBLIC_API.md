# MotionLoom Main Public API

This document lists the recommended public API surface for applications and
open-source users integrating MotionLoom as a standalone Rust crate.

MotionLoom exposes more model structs and compatibility re-exports at the crate
root than this list. Those lower-level types are useful for advanced tooling and
for existing applications such as Anica, but new code should start with
`motionloom::api`.

The crate root is intentionally broader for compatibility. `motionloom::api` is
the curated stable surface. `motionloom::experimental` is public and usable, but
may change faster than the main API.

## API Layers

MotionLoom has three useful integration layers:

1. **Stable APIs** are re-exported from `motionloom::api`.
2. **Easy root-document APIs** accept a full MotionLoom script string and route
   it internally.
3. **Typed scene/process APIs** accept already parsed graphs and are better for
   applications that manage parse/cache/export state themselves.

Use root-document APIs for CLI tools and simple standalone integrations. Use
typed APIs when the host already knows whether the document is a scene graph,
process graph, or app-layer effect.

## Core Parsing

### `parse_graph_script`

```rust
parse_graph_script(script) -> Result<GraphScript, GraphParseError>
```

Parses the main MotionLoom graph format, including scene graphs and
scene/process composition graphs.

Use this when the caller expects a scene/composition graph and wants typed
control over rendering.

### `parse_process_graph_script`

```rust
parse_process_graph_script(script) -> Result<ProcessGraph, GraphParseError>
```

Parses process-only graphs used for effects, Layer FX, and effect runtime
evaluation.

Process-only graphs that reference external inputs such as
`from="input:clip0"` need a host application to provide the source clip.

### `parse_motionloom_document`

```rust
parse_motionloom_document(script) -> Result<MotionLoomDocument, GraphParseError>
```

Parses a root MotionLoom document and classifies it as scene, process, world, or
mixed graph.

Use this when building tools that accept arbitrary MotionLoom DSL input.

## Single Frame Rendering

### `render_scene_graph_frame`

```rust
render_scene_graph_frame(&graph, frame, SceneRenderProfile::Gpu)
```

Renders one scene/composition frame to an `image::RgbaImage`.

This is the simple one-shot API. It creates renderer state internally, so it is
best for single frame exports, tests, or simple examples.

For multiple frames, prefer `SceneRenderer`.

### `SceneRenderer::new`

```rust
let mut renderer = SceneRenderer::new(SceneRenderProfile::Gpu).await?;
```

Creates a reusable scene renderer. Prefer this for preview, playback, PNG
sequence generation, or any integration that renders many frames.

### `SceneRenderer::render_frame`

```rust
renderer.render_frame(&graph, frame).await?
```

Renders one frame using the reusable renderer. This avoids rebuilding internal
state for every frame.

## Export APIs

### Root Document PNG Sequence

```rust
render_motionloom_document_to_png_sequence_with_progress(
    script,
    asset_root,
    output_dir,
    progress_every_frames,
    callback,
)
```

Exports a full MotionLoom script to a PNG frame sequence.

This is the easiest PNG sequence API. It inspects the root document and routes
to the correct renderer internally. It does not require FFmpeg.

### Root Document Video

```rust
render_motionloom_document_to_video_with_progress(
    ffmpeg_bin,
    script,
    asset_root,
    output_path,
    profile,
    progress_every_frames,
    callback,
)
```

Exports a full MotionLoom script to video using FFmpeg.

This API is best for CLI tools or applications that accept arbitrary MotionLoom
documents. The caller supplies the FFmpeg binary path; MotionLoom does not bundle
FFmpeg.

### Typed Scene PNG Sequence

```rust
render_scene_graph_to_png_sequence_with_progress(
    &graph,
    output_dir,
    progress_every_frames,
    callback,
)
```

Exports an already parsed scene/composition graph to PNG frames.

Use this when the caller has already parsed a `GraphScript` with
`parse_graph_script`. It avoids the extra root-document inspect/parse step.

### Typed Scene Video

```rust
render_scene_graph_to_video_with_progress(
    ffmpeg_bin,
    &graph,
    output_path,
    profile,
    progress_every_frames,
    callback,
)
```

Exports an already parsed scene/composition graph to video.

Use this when the caller already knows the graph is scene/composition content.

## Process / Layer FX APIs

### `compile_runtime_program`

```rust
let runtime = compile_runtime_program(graph)?;
```

Compiles a process graph into a runtime program for evaluating effect parameters
over time.

This is the key API for Layer FX-style integrations.

### `RuntimeProgram::evaluate_frame`

```rust
runtime.evaluate_frame(frame)
```

Evaluates process effect parameters for one frame.

### `RuntimeProgram::evaluate_at_time_sec`

```rust
runtime.evaluate_at_time_sec(time_norm, time_sec)
```

Evaluates process effect parameters at an explicit timeline time.

### `RuntimeProgram::unsupported_kernels`

```rust
runtime.unsupported_kernels()
```

Returns kernels that the runtime could not execute natively.

Hosts should report or skip unsupported effects instead of silently pretending
they ran.

## Process Catalog APIs

### `process_effects`

```rust
process_effects()
```

Returns the built-in process effect catalog.

Use this as the source of truth for UI pickers, LLM tooling, and effect
discovery.

### `process_effect_for_id`

```rust
process_effect_for_id("tone_map")
```

Looks up one effect definition.

### `process_effects_for_category`

```rust
process_effects_for_category(category)
```

Lists effects by category.

### `kernel_source_by_name`

```rust
kernel_source_by_name("tone_map.wgsl")
```

Returns embedded WGSL source for a known kernel.

### `is_known_process_kernel`

```rust
is_known_process_kernel("tone_map.wgsl")
```

Checks whether a process kernel is bundled with MotionLoom.

## Preview and GPU Integration

### `SceneRenderer::render_frame_to_wgpu_texture`

```rust
renderer.render_frame_to_wgpu_texture(&graph, frame).await?
```

Renders a frame to a MotionLoom-owned `wgpu::Texture`.

Use this when the host wants GPU output without managing the target texture
itself.

### `SceneRenderer::render_frame_to_wgpu_target_texture`

```rust
renderer
    .render_frame_to_wgpu_target_texture(&graph, frame, target, width, height)
    .await?
```

Renders a frame into a caller-owned `wgpu::Texture`.

This is the preferred path for high-performance host integration because the
host controls texture allocation and reuse. The target texture must belong to
the same `wgpu::Device` used by the renderer.

### `SceneRenderer::render_frame_to_preview_surface`

```rust
renderer
    .render_frame_to_preview_surface(&graph, frame, options)
    .await?
```

Renders a frame to the best preview surface requested by the host.

This is the higher-level preview abstraction. It can return a GPU texture,
platform surface, or CPU BGRA fallback depending on platform support and
options.

## Diagnostics

### `inspect_root_graph`

```rust
inspect_root_graph(script)
```

Inspects a root document and reports whether it contains scene, process, world,
or mixed content.

### `inspect_gpu_compatibility`

```rust
inspect_gpu_compatibility(script)
```

Performs a static GPU compatibility inspection. This is useful before choosing a
preview or export path.

## Experimental / Advanced APIs

The following APIs remain public under `motionloom::experimental`, but should
not be treated as the main MotionLoom integration path yet:

- `parse_world_graph_script`
- `render_world_frame`
- `WorldFrameRenderer`
- `render_world_graph_to_video_with_progress`
- `render_world_graph_to_png_sequence_with_progress`
- GLB metadata and diagnostics helpers
- Anica/editor-oriented helpers such as `experimental::effects`,
  `experimental::keyframe`, `experimental::transitions`, and
  `experimental::clip`
- Text layout preparation helpers under `experimental::text`

Scene/model AST structs such as `RectNode`, `TexNode`, and `PassNode` remain
visible through the crate root for compatibility and advanced tooling. They are
not the recommended starting point for new integrations.

Editor-oriented scene DSL structs are also re-exported at the crate root for
tooling that needs to inspect or generate UI-editable scene graphs:

- `AnimationTargetNode` and `AnimationKeyNode` for UI-editable keyframes with
  `time` or `frame` timing.
- `SkeletonNode`, `SkeletonBoneNode`, `ActionNode`, `ActionPoseNode`,
  `ActionBoneNode`, `ApplyActionNode`, and IK data inside actions for rigs.
- `CharacterNode` and `PartNode` for bone-attached or dense vector artwork.
- `PuppetNode`, `PinNode`, `MeshTopologyNode`, `VertexNode`, `TriangleNode`,
  `EdgeNode`, and `RegionNode` for AE-style pin deformation and optional manual
  topology.
- `FaceJawNode`, `MaskNode`, `CameraNode`, and `SceneLayerNode` for higher-level
  scene helpers.

These model structs are useful for editor/LLM tooling, but they follow the DSL
runtime and may evolve faster than `motionloom::api`. If a host only needs to
render or export scripts, prefer parsing/rendering through `motionloom::api`
instead of constructing AST structs directly.

For editor property panels, use `docs/acp/motionloom/scene-ui-schema.json` as
the machine-readable metadata source for Scene Camera and Layer3D property
labels, groups, value types, and animatability. Do not infer UI schema directly
from the AST structs.

Frame-key UI integrations can use:

- `extract_editable_animation_timeline(script)` to parse `.motionloom` text into
  `EditableAnimationTimeline`.
- `upsert_editable_animation_target(script, target)` to update one
  node/property channel.
- `replace_editable_animation_targets(script, targets)` to replace the full
  editor keyframe set.

These helpers re-parse generated DSL after write-back, so UI saves fail fast
instead of emitting invalid MotionLoom text.

Low-level kernel resolution helpers such as `default_kernel_for_effect` and
`resolve_pass_kernel` are also kept for compatibility. Prefer the process
catalog APIs for effect discovery.

World graph APIs are currently experimental and mainly used by Anica internal
tools and design/debug surfaces.
