# Anica

**An agentic-first video editor where AI is your collaborator, not just a tool.**

Built with Rust, WGPU, GPUI, GStreamer, and FFmpeg for native GPU-accelerated workflows. Talk to your AI agent in natural language - it can inspect your timeline, suggest edits, and run ACP-powered (Agent Client Protocol) workflows from inside the editor.

> **Status:** Alpha - usable for early adopters. APIs, workflows, and project formats may change.
> **Distribution:** Source-only alpha. No prebuilt binaries are published at this stage.

## Why Anica?

Traditional video editors treat AI as an add-on. Anica treats it as part of the editing model.

Instead of jumping between timeline tools, subtitle utilities, and export dialogs, you can talk to an agent that understands the project state and helps drive the workflow.

| Traditional Editor | Anica |
|---|---|
| Manual timeline manipulation | Conversational editing via AI agents |
| Plugin-based AI features | Agent-native architecture |
| Separate analysis/export utilities | Timeline-aware ACP workflows |
| Effect menus and dialogs | Natural-language-assisted editing |

## Features

### Agent-Powered Editing

- **ACP Chat Inside the Editor** - Connect compatible agents and work from one conversation surface.
- **B-Roll Suggestions** - Agents analyze your timeline and suggest relevant B-roll or generated inserts.
- **Auto Silence Removal** - Detect and cut non-speaking segments to tighten pacing.
- **Semantic Speech Cleanup** - Identify low-confidence or duplicate spoken segments for cleaner edits.

### Subtitle and Language Pipeline

- **Local Whisper Model Packs** - Run subtitle generation with local ONNX Whisper packs.
- **Subtitle Translation** - Translate existing subtitles with LLM-backed workflows.
- **Timeline Re-import** - Bring translated subtitles back into the project with timing preserved.

### Media Intelligence and Export

- **Smart Export Workflows** - Trigger export flows from the editor or through agent actions.
- **Project-Level Analysis** - Inspect clip lengths, media types, resolution distribution, and related metadata.
- **Native Preview + Runtime Tooling** - GStreamer powers playback paths; FFmpeg is used for export and analysis.

## Example Agent Prompts

### Silence and Speech Cleanup

```text
Help me cut the silent parts.
Cut silent sections below -14 dB.
Help me cut the silent parts and remove duplicate speech.
```

### Subtitle Translation and Cleanup

```text
Help me translate the subtitles into English.
Please translate the S1 subtitle track into English.
Please translate the S1 subtitle track into Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, and Italian, then place the translated tracks on S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7.
Remove repeated subtitle segments.
Remove silent gaps between subtitle segments and apply the edits directly.
Within any 30-second window, find repeated subtitles with similarity above 0.9. Remove the duplicate sentence segments, keep only the last occurrence, and apply the edits directly.
```

### B-Roll and Semantic Layer Workflows

```text
Suggest B-roll for this sequence.
Suggest B-roll and apply it to a semantic layer.
Suggest B-roll with <language> on-screen text.
```

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LOVELYZOMBIEYHO/anica.git
cd anica
cargo run
```

or

```bash
cargo build --release --bins
```

> Detailed platform setup: [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

### Build Requirements

- Rust `1.90.0` (pinned in [`rust-toolchain.toml`](rust-toolchain.toml))
- GStreamer runtime and development libraries
- On macOS, first `cargo run` attempts to bootstrap the local FFmpeg runtime if missing
- macOS FFmpeg bootstrap still requires Homebrew for build dependencies
- macOS build host: Xcode command-line tools

### Quick Media Setup

On macOS, first `cargo run` attempts to invoke:

```bash
./scripts/setup_media_tools.sh
```

This bootstraps the local FFmpeg runtime when needed, but still depends on Homebrew for FFmpeg build dependencies.

If you want to run the setup manually instead:

```bash
./scripts/setup_media_tools.sh
```

If you want a repo-local media runtime layout, see [docs/MEDIA_RUNTIME_DROPIN.md](docs/MEDIA_RUNTIME_DROPIN.md).

### macOS Initial Setup

If this is your first time running Anica on macOS, install the required host tools first:

```bash
xcode-select -p >/dev/null 2>&1 || xcode-select --install
command -v brew >/dev/null 2>&1 || /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install git gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-editing-services
git clone https://github.com/LOVELYZOMBIEYHO/anica.git
cd anica
cargo run
```

If `cargo` is not installed yet, install Rust first with `rustup` as described in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md).

On macOS, `cargo run` attempts to bootstrap FFmpeg locally when needed.

### Install GStreamer (macOS)

```bash
brew install gstreamer gst-plugins-base gst-plugins-good gst-editing-services
```

### Runtime Notes

- Current macOS builds expect host/Homebrew GStreamer.
- On macOS, Anica attempts to bootstrap FFmpeg on first run if the runtime is missing.
- The startup bootstrap can provision FFmpeg locally when required.

### Fonts

Anica also scans local fonts from:

```text
assets/fonts/
```

Supported local font file types:

- `.otf`
- `.ttf`

These font files are treated as user-provided local assets and are not committed to the repository by default. Only add fonts that you have the right to use and redistribute.

Alpha notice: use at your own risk. Validate media, plugin, and third-party dependency compatibility in your own environment.

## Goals

- Cross-platform support (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- WGPU-based effect rendering and GPU-assisted export pipeline
- Vibe editing, from agent-assisted to fully agent-driven workflows
- Video analysis and LLM-based scoring
- Storyboard generation from text
- Plugin and custom agent API
- Natural language to VFX effects

---

## Use Cases

- **YouTube creators** - Automate rough cuts, silence removal, and subtitle generation across languages.
- **Multilingual content teams** - Translate and re-subtitle projects faster.
- **Rapid prototyping** - Go from idea to rough edit through conversation and agent assistance.

---

## AI Subtitle Model Packs

Anica uses local ONNX Whisper model packs for offline subtitle generation. Place model packs under:

```text
crates/ai-subtitle-engine/src/model/onnx/<model_pack_folder>/
```

Each pack requires `manifest.json`, `config.json`, encoder/decoder ONNX files, and `tokenizer.json`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the manifest expectations.
